## Achievements

> Over the past years, I have revolutionized the UI production process in three AAA titles, and continued this mission within my current UI/UX Programmer role at Chief Rebel.

### Unannounced game at Chief Rebel

* Automated UI import and generation of assets from Figma with C++ plugins built for UE 5.2, achieved since the third month of my tenure.
* The tool imports design tokens, generates style blueprints for Common UI, and automatically downloads textures and fonts.
* UI updates can be performed by designers without the need for programmer/scripter assistance.

### Warface & Armored Warfare

* Successfully integrated a modern Haxe compiler to replace ActionScript.

	* In just a few weeks, over 10 developers have mastered a new language.
	* Significantly reduced the overall rate of bugs due to the strictness of the language.
	* Continually improving and introducing new dev features, thanks to macros. For instance, we have managed to reduce the boilerplate code to zero.
	* [https://haxe.org](https://haxe.org)

* Developed a tool with Figma API integration to auto-export UIs directly from Figma to the game engine in seconds.

	* This integration enabled 5 UI designers to transition from Photoshop to Figma.
	* Developers no longer need to manually create a UI in Flash or elsewhere.
	* Q&As no longer need to spend time comparing the created UIs with designs.
	* Reduced the design and development time for complex UIs from 1 month to 1 week.
	* The company now spends up to 4 times less money on one developer/designer (we now only pay for a Figma subscription).
	* To better understand the impact of this, watch this video showing how I used my Figma pipeline to create a real working Phantom Brigade actions panel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmzafva8uw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmzafva8uw) (I've used only E3 2019 gameplay trailer and screenshots as a source)
	* Also, check the design itself in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bq8wTArnkmHA1Onw8Ao5RR7n/BYG?node-id=2%3A10)
