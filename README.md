> Warface Breakout is the latest one.

![3 AAA Titles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelts/cv/master/images/cards.png)

* Integrated modern Haxe compiler to replace ActionScript.

    * In a few weeks more than 10 developers (for now) have learned a new language
    * Reduced the overall rate of bugs, thanks to the very strict language.
    * Constantly improving and making new dev features, thanks to macros. (For example we have reduced the boilerplate code to zero).
    * https://haxe.org

* Made a tool with Figma API integration to auto-export UI's directly from Figma to the game engine in seconds.

    * Thanks to this integration, 5 UI designers were able to finally switch from Photoshop to Figma.
    * Developers don't need to manually create a UI in Flash or anywhere else.
    * Q&As don't need to spend time comparing the created UI's with designs.
    * Reduced design and development time for the complex UI's from 1 month to 1 week.
    * The company spends up to 4 times less money on one developer/designer (now we only pay for a Figma subscription).
    * To get a better idea of how cool it is, watch this video showing how I used my Figma pipeline to create a real working Phantom Brigade actions panel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmzafva8uw (I've used only E3 2019 gameplay trailer and screenshots as a source
    * Also, check the design itself in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/bq8wTArnkmHA1Onw8Ao5RR7n/BYG?node-id=2%3A10
